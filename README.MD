# Dynamic defensive networking

## Abstract: 
Current standard operating procedure for creating and [indefinitely] maintaining peer-to-peer connections is sub-optimal against adversarial conditions (e.g. eclipse attacks) and information leakage. Develop best defensive practices, such as probabilistically cycling connections. The Fellow may also develop and deploy a modified node that iterates connections over an append-only peerlist to touch base with each known organic node, which should disrupt eclipse attacks and help onboard isolated nodes. The Fellow should (1) Design, (2) Implement, (3) Demo their eclipse guard. 

## Project Motivation: 
Devices cannot detect when they are the victims of an eclipse attack, so having a public resource that inoculates the entire network greatly improves public safety. Best practices can be applied to all decentralized networking protocols.

## Fellow Motivation: 
This project will showcase a nuanced understanding of decentralized networks and their unique attack surfaces, along with a novel solution to mitigate a fundamental attack vector.
